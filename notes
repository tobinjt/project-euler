Project Euler 66:
x^2 - Dy^2 = 1
x^2 - 1 = Dy^2
(x^2 - 1)/D = y^2
sqrt((x^2 - 1)/D) = y

See solution to Project Euler 18.

Project Euler 71:
The result must be between 2/5 and 3/7, so I can probably figure out bounds for
n.  Iterate over d, saving any n/d in the right range, and sort the results.
Or, iterate over d and save the best value as I go.

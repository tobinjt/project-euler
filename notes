69:
Numbers are relatively prime if they do not stare *any* prime factors.  I need the number of relatively prime numbers less than N, which equals (N - (number not relatively prime)).
sieve to get a list of primes <= 500,001.
Create a hash mapping primes to counts called count-numbers-factored-by.
Loop from 1 to 1,000,000:
    Express each number N as a product of primes.
    Initialise a counter to 0.
    For each prime factor of N:
        increment counter by count-numbers-factored-by[prime]
        increment count-numbers-factored-by[prime]
    (N - counter) is phi(N).

Problem 71:
The result must be between 2/5 and 3/7, so I can probably figure out bounds for
n.  Iterate over d, saving any n/d in the right range, and sort the results.
Or, iterate over d and save the best value as I go.
Hmm, another time I wrote:
    Bounds are 3/8 to 3/7
